## Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request! Bug and documentation fixes are welcome.

## None of the above? Create a bug report!

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that we can help you more effectively.
If the information is missing we'll add a 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is 
enough information.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal code snippet**
- [ ] Provide **screenshots** where appropriate
- [ ] What is the **version** of Python you are using?
- [ ] Are you using Mac, Linux or Windows?
